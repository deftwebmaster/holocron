Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012 sent shockwaves through the Force, mandating that the beloved Star Wars Expanded Universe (EU) — now branded as “Legends” — step back from its canon pedestal. A thousand stories and timelines spoke of a rich mosaic, suddenly deemed illustrative but unsanctioned. Yet, for the artful strategists and backroom sages of the galaxy, we wonder: what if Legends had remained canon? Would the Force still guide, or would chaos reign?\nHyperspace Routes Left to Wander Imagine the hyperspace lanes of old: Grand Admiral Thrawn spearheaded tactical brilliance across the pages of Timothy Zahn’s Original Thrawn Trilogy, standing as a pivotal figure amongst strategists and fans alike. His intelligence and cunning posed such a challenge that a reimagined version comfortably slipped into the new canon. Yet, what of the other stories that had illuminated our charts through Legends?\nHeir to the Empire established a post-Endor galaxy, grappling with the rebellion’s overwhelming challenges despite victory at Endor. Legends thrived on exploring power vacuums and creeping resurgence. Characters like Mara Jade, once Emperor’s Hand and eventually a deeply layered protagonist, revealed the might of redemption and complexity. Her arc, erased and rewritten, remains an often whispered longing among fans. Declaring these stories non-canon didn’t erase them from memory, yet it left gaping holes where once vibrant tales flourished. The Thrawn (Canon Trilogy Set) offered a new yet slightly different canvas for the Chiss mastermind, trading some of the old for fresh illustrations of imperial loyalty.\nExperience Thrawn’s rise through the Empire in this action-packed trilogy.\nVistas of the Old Republic In the historical realms of Legends, time becomes a curious construct. The Old Republic, millennia before Skywalker ever tinkered with landspeeders, offered an era rich with political intrigue, complex Jedi ideologies, and, of course, the rakish mysteries of the Sith.\nThe advent of the Mandalorian Wars and the subsequent Jedi Civil War painted a stage of galactic conflict that resonated into games and comics alike. Lords like Revan and Malak emerged, shaping the shadowside of the Force in hauntingly charismatic fashion. Consider Darth Bane, whose Rule of Two left an indelible mark on Sith strategy — dynamics that recontextualize the power struggles seen centuries after. Keeping Legends’ Old Republic in canon might have allowed the saga’s history to stretch its tendrils into intertwined stories, illuminating the foundations upon which later sagas stand. Speculation abounds on tales like these being revisited, an avenue yet underexploited in the current collective storytelling.\nInfinities Abound Let’s journey now to the brave world of the “what if” — an embracing of diverging paths and alternate pasts. Legends freely played in these sands with Infinities, while canon adheres to stiff guidelines and ultimate truths.\nConsider possibilities nurtured in these tales:\nA Death Star not destroyed due to a timely mechanical failure, causing a Rebel retreat at Yavin. Luke turning to the Dark Side, wearing Vader’s mantle in flesh and shadow, starkly contrasting his chosen path. These Infinities remind us of the narrative risks and colorful flexibility Legends could swagger into with a smuggler’s confidence. In some corners of the galaxy, an Empire T-Shirt might proudly display a victorious Vader, symbolizing might and inevitability that never transpired.\nShow your allegiance in style.\nCollaborations of Canon and Legends Now that Disney’s canon reigns, remnants of Legends material appear like echoes across the battlefields. There’s no telling when you might see a familiar face — or hear the mechanical whine of a Droideka from a once-erased battlefield.\nTwo parallel stories might never fully merge, yet these enduring shadows offer new depth to the ongoing saga. Just as Ahsoka outlasted obstacles manifold, the potential for these tales to dance again under the starlight remains potent.\nBuild your own intrigue with droid-like precision.
