<p><em>Legends never ask permission. They survive by being too good to forget.</em></p>
<p>This timeline isn’t just a list — it’s a curated distillation of the most pivotal, powerful, and character-defining moments in the Expanded Universe. Before the canon was reset, the real galaxy was built here: through warlords and wanderers, tacticians and traitors, fallen Jedi and forgotten heirs.</p>
<p>I’ve trimmed the noise. What’s left is signal — the must-reads, in the order that hits hardest.</p>
<p>Start anywhere you like. But once you begin, don’t be surprised if the galaxy starts feeling a little too real.</p></blockquote>
